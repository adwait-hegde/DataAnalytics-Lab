## Objective: 
Perform Hypothesis testing using f-test with SAS

## Problem Statement:
This analysis is aimed at those who are interested in statistics related to species of Iris  Flowers. The dataset contains various attributes associated the flowers such as Sepal Length,  Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width. The main aim is to determine if the mean of magnitude Petal Length and Width of all species of flower is same or different.

### Dataset used: SASHELP.IRIS

### Null hypothesis: 
The mean of Petal Length and Width of all species of flower is same

### Alternate hypothesis: 
The mean of Petal Length and Width of all species of flower is different

## Conclusion:
Since the p-value obtained for both the case in the table is < 0.001, i.e., the p-value is < 0.01, the null hypothesis can be rejected. Therefore, the Alternate hypothesis is accepted which states that the mean of Petal Length and Width of all species of flower is different
